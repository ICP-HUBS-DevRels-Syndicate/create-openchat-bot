# OpenChat Bots Tutorial

This repository contains comprehensive resources for creating AI-powered bots in the OpenChat ecosystem. It includes a template for getting started and examples of both off-chain and on-chain bot implementations.

## Directory Structure

1. `openchat-bot-template/` - A starter template that can be forked or installed to begin creating OpenChat bots
2. `openchat-bot-offchain-example/` - An example implementation of an off-chain OpenChat bot
3. `openchat-bot-onchain-example/` - An example implementation of an on-chain OpenChat bot (running as a canister)

## Getting Started

Each directory contains its own README with specific instructions for that implementation. Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

- Use the template if you want to start from scratch
- Check the off-chain example if you want to run a bot without deploying a canister
- Check the on-chain example if you want to deploy your bot as a canister on the Internet Computer

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- dfx (for on-chain development)
- OpenChat account and API credentials
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript
- For on-chain development: knowledge of Motoko or Rust
